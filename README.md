### Introduction
This tutorial demonstrates how to use functions developed to read, process and create large spatial (Headwall raster) data sets. In principle, both examples follow the same systematic approach:
1. Preparing your spectral library
2. Building classification model 
3. Classifying Headwall Hyperspectral Raster
